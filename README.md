# Bowling_monitor

## How to use:
1. There are three files in this repository, clone them.
2. The input for this bowling monitor is a text file (**score.text**) with the number of pins knocked down per "roll" or turn - feel free to change the contents of this file. This program will only take 21 integers, as this is the maximum number of turns in a 10-frame game. 
3. In **startGame.java**, line 14 defines the location of **score.text**. The current location is specific to my personal setup, please change to match the location in your setup.


Thanks!!!
